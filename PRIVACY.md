# Command Center Extension Privacy Policy

## Data Collection

CommandCenter does not collect any user data. Since no data is collected, none of your data can be sold to third parties.

Here are the sources of data that CommandCenter uses to function. None of this data ever leaves your device, with the exception of the Storage API that will sync your configuration to your other devices with the same Google Profile signed in. No browsing, history, or bookmark data is ever transmitted across the network or to a third party.
That being said, there are a few other ways your data is used.
